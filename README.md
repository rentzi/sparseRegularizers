# sparseRegularizers
Generative model with different thresholding functions based on an upcoming paper


### Getting started
install jupyter, numpy, and matplotlib

follow the instructions and run `0 download preproces and whiten images` to download the natural images from the __Hateren Schaaf database__, to preprocess it, and to create and store input image patches for the generative algorithm

change the variables accordingly and run `1 Generative model with different regularizers` to process the input image patches with the generative model with a regularizer
